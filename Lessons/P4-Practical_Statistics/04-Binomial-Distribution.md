# P4 - 04: Binomial Distribution

## Statistics
Analyze the data from the past events to infer what those models or causes could be.

## Probability
Make predictions about future events based on models or causes that we assume.

- Probability of event: p
- Probability of opposite event: 1-P
- Probability of composite event: P*P*P...* P

## Binomial distribution
The Binomial Distribution helps us determine the probability of a string of independent 'coin flip like events'. E.g. Heads or tails, buy or not buy, fraud or not fraud.

### To get the total no. of ways:

k = no. of Heads
p(head) = probability of Heads

e.g. 3 heads & 4 flips
k = 3, n = 4

n! / (n-k)!k! = 4!/(4-3)!3! = 4!/1!3! = 4
