# P4 - 06: Conditional Probability

## Statistics
Analyze the data from the past events to infer what those models or causes could be.

## Probability
Often events are not independent like with coin flips and dice rolling. Instead, the outcome of one event depends on an earlier event.

- P(A) means "the probability of A"
- P(Â¬A) means "the probability of NOT A"
- P(A,B) means "the probability of A and B" and
- P(A|B) means "the probability of A given B.

Example:
- If A and B are independent events and P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.1, what is P(A,B)?
0.02 (Probabilities just multiply for independent events.)

- If A and B are NOT independent events, and P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.1, what is P(A, B)?
Not enough information

- If A and B are NOT independent events, and P(A) = 0.2, P(B) = 0.1, and P(B|A) = 0.3 what is P(A|B)?
