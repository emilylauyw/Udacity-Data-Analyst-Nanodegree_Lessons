#### Box Plot: Useful for quickly comparing the spread of two data sets
- Data varies: if it is broader, the data varies much more than the other
- Range: visualize the box plot distance from start to end
- Interquartile range: distance from the start box to the end box is the

#### Standard Deviation or Variance: (1) Compare the spread of different group to determine which is more spread out (2) High Standard Deviation is Associated with Higher Risk; When data pertains to money or the economy, having higher standard deviation is associated with having higher risk.
- Standard Deviation: the average distance of each observation from the mean
- Variance: average squared difference of each observation from the mean

Calculation:
- Variance - First you must find the mean. Then the difference between each observation and the mean. Then you square, sum, and divide by the number of observations.
- Standard Deviation - Square Root of Variance
