### Box Plot
Useful for quickly comparing the spread of two data sets.
- Data varies: if it is broader, the data varies much more than the other
- Range: visualize the box plot distance from start to end
- Interquartile range: distance from the start box to the end box is the

### Standard Deviation or Variance
Compare the spread of data to determine which is more spread out.
- Standard Deviation: the average distance of each observation from the mean
- Variance: average squared difference of each observation from the mean

Calculation:
- Variance: First you must find the mean. Then the difference between each observation and the mean. Then you square, sum, and divide by the number of observations.
- Standard Deviation: Square Root of Variance

### Important Final Points
1. The variance is used to compare the spread of two different groups. A set of data with higher variance is more spread out than a dataset with lower variance. Be careful though, there might just be an outlier (or outliers) that is increasing the variance, when most of the data are actually very close.
2. When comparing the spread between two datasets, the units of each must be the same.
3. When data are related to money or the economy, higher variance (or standard deviation) is associated with higher risk.
4. The standard deviation is used more often in practice than the variance, because it shares the units of the original dataset.

Use in the World:
- The standard deviation is associated with risk in finance, assists in determining the significance of drugs in medical studies, and measures the error of our results for predicting anything from the amount of rainfall we can expect tomorrow to your predicted commute time tomorrow.

### Shape
How to use Histograms to determine shape associated with data.
- Left Skewed: shorter bins on the left and taller bins on the right, is considered a left skewed shape.
- Right Skewed:
